# Code Refactor

## Description

As a new developer, it's very important for me to practice cleaning code to help develop my skills. This project came with a base template that was built to in a sloppy fashion which allowed me to come in and make repairs. After editing the code, I transanformed into a much neater display that could be easily navigated by any editor. I learned a lot about DRY (do not reapeat yourself) and efficient code writing.
